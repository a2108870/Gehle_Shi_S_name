This GitHub repository contains the Gehle_Shi Single-illumination dataset, and these image names are stored in the `Gehle_Shi_S_name.mat` folder. Additionally, it includes the implementation of three color constancy algorithms: `CLP_main.m`, `BCC.m`, and `LRD.m`. These algorithms are non-official reproductions of the following research papers:

1. Improving color constancy using chromaticity-line prior Zhao Z, Hu H M, Zhang H, et al. IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, 2022.
2. Block-Based Color Constancy: The Deviation of Salient Pixels - Ulucan O, Ulucan D, Ebner M. ICASSP 2023-2023 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), 2023.
3. Color Constancy Based on Local Reflectance Differences - Yan M, Hu Y, Zhang H. Electronics, 2023.
